##Description
This project is a food inventory app that allows you to keep track of what food items you have stored in the house. Have you ever put something in the fridge only to forget about it? Then you go to the store and buy more of that item? This is to help prevent that. Always know what is in your fridge, pantry, food storage, garage, etc. Set a quantity for an item and an expiration date, as well as notes about the item.
