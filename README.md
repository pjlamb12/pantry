# MEAN Seed by [pjlamb12](http://www.twitter.com/plambweb)

##Description
This project is my own MEAN stack seed project to get started with MEAN web apps quickly and efficiently.

The AngularJS portion is taken from my own [AngularJS Seed project](https://github.com/pjlamb12/angular-base/tree/ui-router), ui-router branch.

AngularJS comes with angular-bootstrap, angular-ui-router, bootstrap, jquery, angular-resource, and toastr.

Passport, passport-local, mongoose, and express all come pre-loaded as well.

##Starting
To get the project running, run `npm install && bower install`. After installing dependencies, run `node server.js`. If you have nodemon installed, you can also run `npm start`, and it will run `npm install && bower install` before starting up your server.
